**SETTINGS/CUSTOMIZATION**
*Some customizations described here are available in Premium version. Please refer to premium feature summary below.*

To have 10Web Facebook Feed plugin up and running you have to create an app on Facebook. This is a required step by Facebook, but it's pretty easy once you check the plugin's user guide. Under the plugin's general options you provide Facebook app ID and secret, and then you can specify the feed auto update interval, choose the date format for posts and events, and more.

Adding feeds is just a matter of a few clicks. You just click on the **Add new** button from the feeds section of the plugin, and a new window with four setting tabs will open, including settings for the feed, lightbox, comments and events. From the main feed settings you set the page to create a feed with. Under the main settings you can also choose whether you display the whole timeline of the feed, or choose to display only specific content, such as only photos, videos, links or events.

With a Facebook page feed, you can filter out the content based on user roles, and show posts and updates only from the page owner or other users from the group, or both. There is a long list of the lightbox settings you can enable, including social share buttons, showing comments, playing filmstrip, and more. The comments settings mainly include choosing comment filtering option, whether its top level or stream, with the former being the same structure as in Facebook and the latter including all-level comments. Here you can also enable showing the comment replies and choose commenting order.
